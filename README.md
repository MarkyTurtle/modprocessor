At the moment I've implemented a 4 bit delta 'compress' and 'decompress' commands based on some code seen on h0ffman's Twitch stream last week. 
The sound quality is not great (tested on the infinite dreams redux project that im working on). Maybe a bug in my implementation, the code is largelt untested.

I intend to implement a 4bit delta compression this week, im hoping for better quality sound from that, or not... :-)
